# after building the executables (configure and make in the HD directory)

# make the continuum mesh:

cd make_mesh
# (setupPore.csh requires a number of executables be built in HD/optimized or HD/debug)
csh setupPore.csh
cd ..

# then build the all-atom structure:

cd make_all_atom
hd.opt create.inp > create.out
# (hd.opt is built in HD/optimized)
charmm < create_pore_charmm.inp > create_pore_charmm.out

# where here charmm is a charmm executable (publically available).

# this will generate system.psf and system.crd with periodic boundary conditions defined by the mesh ( 190 x 190 x 200 )
